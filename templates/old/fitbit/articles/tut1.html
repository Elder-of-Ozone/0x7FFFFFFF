		<h1 class = "post-title"> Authenticating fitbit with oauth2 and python for continuous or singular usage  </h1>
		<span class = "post-date"> 2nd March 2016 </span>
	

		<p>This is the beginning of a series of tutorials on how to combine fitbit's API with 
		python. All the hard work has been done for us in a library called <a href="https://github.com/orcasgit/python-fitbit/">python-fitbit</a>
		By the end, I hope you can use some of the tools and templates for your
		projects.</p>

		<p>I'm not going to start at the beginning because there has been plenty of other
		good tutorials out there. I recommend reading those first and getting familar with
		the language. I would also recommend actually reading the <a href="https://dev.fitbit.com/docs/">fitbit API docs </a>, including
		the implementation of <a href="https://dev.fitbit.com/docs/oauth2/"> oauth2.0. </a></p>

		<p>So here is a bunch of prerequisite reading for you:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://roboticape.wordpress.com/2014/01/13/first-steps-into-the-quantified-self-getting-to-know-the-fitbit-api/">Getting to know the Fitbit API</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://pdwhomeautomation.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/fitbit-api-access-using-oauth20-and.html">Fitbit API access and using oauth2 and raspberry pi </a></li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>


		<p>Okay, let's get stuck into it.</p>

		<p>For part one, I'm going to show you how to get an initial API application running.
		Now I know you did this with the prerequisite tutorials, however I'm taking
		this one step further actually making an application that will run continuously.</p>

		<p>We are going to be using configParser to handle the tokens. You might possibly
		use YAML or JSON if you so desired.</p>

		<p>Create a file called config.ini with the content has followed:</p>
		<pre>[param]
c_id = [INSERT YOUR CLIENT ID]
c_secret = [INSERT YOUR CLIENT SECRET]</pre>
		
{% load static %}	
		
		
<script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'js/shCore.js' %}"> </script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'css/shBrushPython.js' %}"> </script>

<link href="{% static  'css/shCore.css' %}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<link href="{% static 'css/shThemeDefault.css' %}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

<!-- Include required JS files -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/shCore.js"></script>
 
<!--
	    At least one brush, here we choose JS. You need to include a brush for every 
		    language you want to highlight
-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="css/shBrushJScript.js"></script>
 


<p>And here is a snippet of corresponding python code</p>


<pre class = "brush: python">

import fitbit
import ConfigParser
import time

# Save a file named config.ini with the following contents:
# c_id      = [INSERT YOUR CLIENT ID]
# c_secret  = [INSERT YOUR CLIENT SECRET]

# first we read our config file
parser = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser()
parser.read('config.ini')

# Then we get our client id and secrets. 
configName = 'param'

client_id = parser.get(configName, 'c_id')
client_secret = parser.get(configName, 'c_secret')
		</pre>
===

<!-- Finally, to actually run the highlighter, you need to include this JS on your page -->
<script type="text/javascript">
     SyntaxHighlighter.all()
</script>


		<p>These details are enough to make our first call to the fitbit API and gain consent. 
		If you have read the documents as I suggested, you would have learnt we have two different
		oauth2 methods (implicit and Authoziation code grants). Their importance is out of scope with
		this tutorial but it's worth understanding which method we are implementing for debugging purposes.
		It is also worth noting that the Authorization code grant method does not allow
		for extending token timeouts.</p>

		<p>We have been told by fitbit not to use embed the authorization page. So therefore we need access to the browser.
		This means those using headless raspberry pi's won't be able to do this initial step.
		Don't worry though! Just hook up a monitor and you will be ready to go by the end of this
		tutorial. </p>


		<p>This is probably going to be the most important paragraph in this tutorial so pay attention. 
		Looking through lines  XXX to XXX, we have the initial call to fitbit's API and we print
		a URL. Open this URL and your browser will timeout. Now look at the URL and you'll notice
		that it has changed ending with code=*********************************. Copy and paste your code
		into the awaiting executed python script. </p>

		<p>Since we do not want to go through this procedure every time we execute the script,
		we save the tokens. Next time we want to excute the script, we will try to read the 
		refresh and access tokens from the file and convert them to unicode.
		This give us enough information to create an object. </p>






<pre>try:
    refresh_token = parser.get(configName, 'r_token')
	access_token = parser.get('param', 'a_token')

	refresh_token = unicode(refresh_token, "utf-8")
	access_token =  unicode(access_token, "utf-8")
	print "Access and Refresh token already created, so let's create our model."

	# Now we create our client model. Note we have oauth2 = true 
	#since oauth1.0 is depreceiated.
	client = fitbit.Fitbit(client_id, client_secret, oauth2=True, access_token = access_token, refresh_token = refresh_token) 
								     

except:

	client = fitbit.Fitbit(client_id, client_secret, oauth2=True)


	print client.client.authorize_token_url(expires_in = '86400', redirect_uri='http://127.0.0.1:8080/')
										     
	code = raw_input()

	redirect_uri = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/'
	client.client.fetch_access_token(code = code, redirect_uri = redirect_uri)

	refresh_token = client.client.token['refresh_token']
	access_token = client.client.token['access_token']

	parser.set(configName, 'r_token', refresh_token)
	parser.set(configName, 'a_token', access_token)
																	     
	with open('config.ini', 'wb') as configfile:
		parser.write(configfile)
	
	pass
</pre>


		<p>Now it's time for the fun bit! What you've all come here to do.
		By following these steps, you can now use the API!</p>

		<p>If you want to have the program executed in the background,
		it is best handled with a loop. The important thing here is refreshing
		the tokens and saving to a file. This is because the access token has a lifespan of an hour.
		The refresh token, on the other hand, has a lifepan of 14 days.</p>

		<p>If you want to run the program once with crontab etc and do 
		not require a loop, you will still need to refresh tokens at
		the beginning of what you're doing and saving that information
		to a file.</p>



		<pre>


while True:
	client.client.refresh_token()
	
	# DO STUFF
			        
	print client.sleep()
					       

	refresh_token = client.client.token['refresh_token']
	access_token = client.client.token['access_token']

	parser.set(configName, 'r_token', refresh_token)
	parser.set(configName, 'a_token', access_token)
													       
	config = open("config.ini",'wb')
	parser.write(config)
	config.close()

	# Halt program for a certain time before starting the loop again. 
	time.sleep(30)
