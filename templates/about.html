		<p> As you would have guessed, I'm a passionate for related to IT
		and the environment. Having spent the last six years studying
		environmental science and hydrogeology, I wish to expand my horizons
		and begin writing about it.</p>

		<p>However I'm sure this is just going to be a medium where I blab on about
		my current projects, linux and other programming ventures</p>

		<p>This website is dedicated to my wife. She has continued to stand by me 
		for the past 2 years and has put up with many of my frustrations.  
		She fulfils my utility function</p>

		You can access my CV <a href="/media/AaronFordhamCV.pdf">here</a>.
